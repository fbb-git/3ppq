Pages are included after copying

    <!DOCTYPE html>
    <html>
    <head>
        <meta http-equiv="content-type" content="text/html;
              charset=windows-1252"> 
         <link rel="stylesheet" type="text/css" href="/css/3ppq.css">
        <style></style>

to cout. Note that the head is not closed.
Pages may include stuff that belongs to the head, e.g.,

    <script src="/js/preamble.js"></script>
    <script src="/js/psychologist.js"></script>

and then should do

    </head>
    <body>

followed by the body's contents.
At the end, </body> is provided by the 'form' program


Forms must be named 'form', validation js functions should be called
'validate'. A standard form opening looks like this:

    <form name="form" action="/bin/form" onsubmit="return validate()" 
          method="post">

Input-submit fields do not need 'name=' fields, as the form's states are used
to determine the next action

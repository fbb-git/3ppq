This document contains an overview of web-pages that are handled by the 3ppq
software. The web-pages may be modified em(ad lib) as long as their
preconditions and postconditions are satisfied. Minor modifications of the
current pages can be handled by the author. Once pages are replaced by
external parties the author can no longer handle modification requests for
those pages, but replacements can be installed by the author, and may
eventually directly be installed by authorized replacement editors.

The program inserts its html page in a file organized like this:

    <!DOCTYPE html>
    <html>
    
    <!-- DOCUMENT_URI=/psychologist.shtml -->
    
    <!--#exec cmd="/home/frank/src/psycho/bin/formhandler" -->
    
    </html>

Since the program is used from different .shtml files it can use the
DOCUMENT_URI environment variable to determine which page it was called from.

Main's job is to create a FormHandler, which then processes the form, calling
its .process() member. 

FormHandler's constructor (formhandler1.cc) prepares an FBB::CGI object: the
CGI object handles the form, and opens the log-file, relative to 
'basePath', passed from main() as main's g_base: all files are below this
location, preferably ~/data: a directory 'data' below the user's homedir.

Below, ~/data is used, but note that in fact it is the location specified by
main.cc's g_base.


The skeletons of the webpages to return are found in ~/data/formhandler. 
A Display object handles the files in that directory. Display::setBase sets
~/data/formhandler for all Display objects.


FormHandler::process() uses the environment variable DOCUMENT_URI to determine
from which location formhandler was called. Currently it can be
/psychologist.shtml and /client.shtml. If another URI is used it is logged by
FormHandler::empty(), and the caller is shown an empty page.

members returning web-content do so by creating a Display object, passing it
the name of the file containing the web-contents. Those files (in
~/data/formhandler) may contain \$ characters, signaling eoln comment. eoln
comment is not written to the returned web-page

To run a test define the environment variable 

    DOCUMENT_URI /psychologist.shtml

and run tmp/bin/binary

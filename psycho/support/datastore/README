The DataStore object uses a DataIdx object to store the locations where
information is stored.

The DataIdx file starts with a header consisting of three uint16_t values:
    
    - the number of keys currently in use
    - the numbr of bits used when computing primes
    - the number of available locations (the capacity)

Following the header, `capacity' Entries follow. Each entry consists of two
elements:

    - Tools::KEY_SIZE bytes holding the # bytes used for comuting the
            hash-value of the key (currently, the key is the e-mail address,
            the hash is MD5, the key size equals 16)

    - offset: the offset of the data in the DataStore file.

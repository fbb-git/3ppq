Pages are included after copying

    <!DOCTYPE html>
    <html>
    <head>
        <meta http-equiv="content-type" content="text/html;
              charset=windows-1252"> 
        <link rel="stylesheet" type="text/css" href="/css/3ppq.css">
        <meta name="viewport" content="width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0">


to cout. Note that the head is not closed.
Pages may include stuff that belongs to the head: start by including 'head':

    <script src="/js/preamble.js"></script>
    <script src="/js/XXX.js"></script>
</head>

<body class="full"> 
<div class="container">

<header class='title'>
    Persoonlijkheid in perspectief
</header>


followed by the body's contents.
At the end, </div></body></html> is provided by the 'form' program


All pages must be forms, validation js functions should be called
'validate'. A standard form opening looks like this:

    <form name="form" action="/bin/form" onsubmit="return validate()" 
          method="post">

The matching     </form> is added by the program.

Input-submit fields do not need 'name=' fields, as the form's states are used
to determine the next action
